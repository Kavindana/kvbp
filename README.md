# My Portfolio Website

This is a **dark-themed personal portfolio website** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It features modern design elements, smooth CSS animations, and a responsive layout. The code is commented to explain each section for easy future updates.

## Features
- **Dark Mode Design:** Uses light text on a dark background to reduce eye strain:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. Accent colors highlight links and buttons.
- **CSS Animations:** Elements fade in, cards elevate on hover, and background elements animate subtly. These enhancements create a dynamic experience without sacrificing performance:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.
- **Responsive Layout:** Mobile-first design with a collapsible navigation menu. The site looks great on desktop, tablet, and phone.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links animate scrolling to sections for a polished feel.
- **Accessible:** Follows best practices (e.g. `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected to accommodate users sensitive to motion:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}).

## Files
- `index.html` – The main HTML structure, including sections for Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
- `style.css` – CSS styles and animations (using variables for easy theming).
- `script.js` – JavaScript for interactive features (mobile nav toggle, smooth scroll, scroll animations).
- Images (e.g. `hero-bg.jpg`, `profile.jpg`, `project1.png`) placed in an `img/` folder.

## Design Choices
- **Images:** Chosen to reflect my work and personality. For example, the hero background is a photo of a developer workspace. Each project card uses a relevant screenshot. A diverse set of images showcases different skills:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.
- **Animations:** Used sparingly to draw attention. For instance, project cards move slightly on hover, and sections fade into view. These effects follow UX advice to use motion purposefully and not overwhelm the user:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}.
- **Comments:** The code is commented thoroughly. For example, HTML comments explain the purpose of each `<section>`, and CSS comments outline style sections. This makes it easy to extend the site (add new projects or sections) later.

## Image Guidelines
- Include only your best visuals (about 10% of your work) to make a strong impression:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}.
- Ensure images are high-quality and optimized for web.
- Maintain a consistent style (e.g. color tone, lighting).

## How to Use
- Clone or download this repository.
- Replace the placeholder content (name, bio, images, project details) with your own.
- Run `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
- No build tools are required; it’s a static site with plain HTML/CSS/JS.

## Credits
- CSS animation examples and guidance were inspired by resources like Prismic’s [CSS animation examples] and Slider Revolution’s blog:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}.
- Design tips for dark mode and accessibility are based on UX best practices:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}.
